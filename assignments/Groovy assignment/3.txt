Create a list of strings. Sort them alphabetically. Sort them by length. Sort them by length in descending order.

solution:-
list= ['hill' , 'hello', 'cat', 'his', 'where', 'fridge'];
list=list.sort();
println("sorted alphabetically: "+ list);

list=list.sort(key=len);
println("sorted by length: "+ list);

list=list.sort(key=len, reverse=True);
println("sorted by length: "+ list);
